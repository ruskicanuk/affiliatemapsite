# Refactored "Via X" Button Logic - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The "Via X" button logic has been completely refactored according to the specified algorithm using proper set operations and intersection logic to find transfer airports.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Database Cleanup
- **Updated data source**: Changed from `flights.jsonl` to `flightsFixed.jsonl` (cleaned version with duplicates merged)
- **Duplicates removed**: Paris, France and Washington, United States entries were merged
- **Records reduced**: From 103 to 101 flight records

### 2. Algorithm Refactor
Completely replaced the old `findRoutesForDestination()` function with the new algorithm:

#### Old Algorithm Issues:
- Used bidirectional lookup with candidate cities
- Limited discovery of connection points
- Complex and potentially missed valid routes

#### New Algorithm (Per Specifications):
1. **Step 1**: Get `ServicesStartingAirport1` - airports that Starting Airport serves directly
2. **Step 2**: Get `ServicesStartingAirport2` - airports that have Starting Airport as a service
3. **Step 3**: Combine into `ServicesStartingAirportCombined` (union operation)
4. **Step 4-6**: Repeat for each ending airport (POP, STI, SDQ, PUJ) to get `ServicesEndingAirportCombined`
5. **Find Intersection**: Transfer airports = intersection of starting and ending airport services
6. **Direct flights first**: Always ensure direct flights appear at the top of each column

### 3. New Helper Functions Added

#### `getDirectServicesFromAirport(airportKey)`
- Returns airports that a given airport serves directly
- Implements "ServicesX1" logic

#### `getAirportsServingOrigin(originKey)`
- Returns airports that have the given airport as a service
- Implements "ServicesX2" logic

#### `combineAirportSets(set1, set2)`
- Performs union operation on two sets of airports
- Combines ServicesX1 and ServicesX2

#### `findIntersection(set1, set2)`
- Finds intersection between starting and ending airport services
- These intersections become the "Via X" transfer options

#### `findDirectFlight(originKey, destinationKey)`
- Simplified direct flight lookup
- Replaces complex bidirectional logic

#### `getFlightDetails(originKey, destinationKey, services1, services2)`
- Gets flight details for route legs
- Handles both forward and reverse flight lookups
- Used for displaying airline service details

### 4. Terminology Alignment
The code now uses the exact terminology specified:
- **Starting Airport**: User input from dropdown
- **Transfer Airport**: Intersection airports that serve as connections
- **Ending Airport**: One of POP, STI, SDQ, PUJ
- **FlightRecordsAll**: flightsFixed.jsonl file
- **FlightRecordsTarget**: Individual destination records
- **TargetAirportToServiceAirportRecord**: Specific origin-destination service records

### 5. Flight Details Display
- **Flight 1**: Uses union of ServicesStartingAirport1 and ServicesStartingAirport2
- **Flight 2**: Uses union of ServicesEndingAirport1 and ServicesEndingAirport2
- Maintains existing airline service detail display format

## Expected Improvements

### 1. More Comprehensive Route Discovery
- **Better coverage**: The intersection-based approach should find more valid "Via X" options
- **Calgary → Santiago "via Boston"**: Should now appear if Boston serves both Calgary and Santiago routes
- **Systematic approach**: No longer relies on bidirectional guessing

### 2. Cleaner Data Structure
- **Eliminated duplicates**: Merged duplicate destination records
- **Consistent data**: All flight information properly consolidated

### 3. Performance Benefits
- **Set operations**: More efficient than nested loops
- **Clear logic flow**: Easier to debug and maintain
- **Predictable results**: Deterministic intersection-based approach

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Calgary → Santiago**: Verify "via Boston" button appears
2. **Test major hubs**: Check that cities like Toronto, New York, Miami show as transfer options
3. **Test direct flights**: Ensure direct flights always appear first
4. **Test all 4 destinations**: Verify each column shows appropriate "Via X" options
5. **Test flight details**: Confirm airline information displays correctly for both legs

## Debugging Features

The new algorithm provides clear debugging points:
- Log `servicesStartingAirportCombined` to see all airports reachable from origin
- Log `servicesEndingAirportCombined` to see all airports that can reach destination
- Log `transferAirports` to see the intersection (actual "Via X" options)

## Files Modified

1. **script.js**: Complete refactor of route finding logic
2. **flightsFixed.jsonl**: New cleaned flight data file (created by analyze_duplicates.js)

## Files Created

1. **analyze_duplicates.js**: Script to identify and merge duplicate destinations
2. **via_city_button_logic_pseudocode.md**: Detailed pseudo code documentation
3. **refactored_via_button_logic_summary.md**: This summary document

The refactored implementation should provide more comprehensive and reliable "Via X" button options while maintaining the existing user interface and flight details display functionality.
